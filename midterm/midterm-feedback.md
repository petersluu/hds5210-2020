50 / 50

You did an excellent job on this.  Keep up the good work!


## Part 1: Creating a JSON Rules File
Comments - Nice work.  They all look great.  I especially like how you handled FiO2.  That was different than what I did, but I like it a lot!

## Part 2: Functions to evaluate rules
Comments - These all look great in general.  I like your "score with range" function and how you even built in the "sub layer" idea.  Superb!

Nice job with the testing, too.

## Part 3: Put it all together
Comments - Nice and simple.

## Part 4: Accessing and processing the patient file
Comments - Excellent!!
